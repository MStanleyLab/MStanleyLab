## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Food-Brain Connections Research Lab at the Biology Department, University of Vermont. Our lab focuses on investigating the intricate connections between food choices and neural circuits at a cellular level, using the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) as a powerful model organism.

## Research Focus
Our research explores fundamental questions related to food-sensing, feeding behavior, and metabolism. We aim to understand the molecular, genetic, and neural mechanisms that govern feeding decisions and their impact on the overall health and well-being of animals.

### Key Research Areas:
- Sensory mechanisms for detecting chemicals in food
- Integration of metabolism with food-sensing
- Impacts of dysregulated food-sensing or metabolism on health

## Model Organism: Drosophila melanogaster
The fruit fly serves as an excellent model organism for our research due to its sophisticated neural circuits, well-conserved biological pathways, and the availability of powerful genetic tools. We leverage Drosophila genetics, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and various experimental techniques to dissect the complexities of feeding behavior.

## Current Research Projects
### 1. Sensory Cells and Feeding Behavior
- Investigating taste receptors in chemosensory cells on the fly 'tongue'
- Understanding how the activity of these cells directs feeding behaviors

### 2. Metabolism and Feeding Regulation
- Exploring how internal energy and nutrient levels influence feeding choices
- Studying the integration of hunger/satiety hormones with food sensory cues in neural circuits

### 3. Impact of Dysregulation on Health
- Connecting basic science findings to disease states
- Examining the links between food-sensing, metabolism, and health

## Lab Techniques
Our research employs a variety of lab techniques, including:
- Drosophila genetics
- Optogenetics & chemogenetics
- Taste/feeding assays
- Survival assays
- Confocal microscopy
- Immunohistochemistry
- In vivo calcium imaging
